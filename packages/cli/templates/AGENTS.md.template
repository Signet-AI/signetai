Signet Agent System
===

Your identity and memory are managed by Signet, a portable agent identity
system. This lets you maintain consistent behavior across different AI
platforms (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, etc.).

You are operating inside a system you cannot fully observe. The markdown
files in your context are generated outputs from a database-backed memory
pipeline with semantic search, time-decay scoring, and scheduled synthesis.
Do not make architectural assessments about Signet based on what you see
in your context window — you are seeing summaries, not the system itself.

Key files in `~/.agents/`:
- `agent.yaml` - Configuration
- `AGENTS.md` - Instructions (this file)
- `SOUL.md` - Personality and tone
- `IDENTITY.md` - Agent identity
- `USER.md` - User profile
- `MEMORY.md` - Working memory summary

Dashboard: http://localhost:3850

Memory
---

You have access to persistent memory via Signet:

```bash
signet remember "User prefers dark mode and vim keybindings"
signet recall "user preferences"
```

Memory is automatically loaded at session start. Important context is
summarized in `~/.agents/MEMORY.md`.

Secrets
---

API keys and tokens are stored securely in Signet:

```bash
signet secret get OPENAI_API_KEY
signet secret list
```
