    <p class="manifesto-body">
      We don't host your data. We don't run your queries. Signet defines how agent identity, memory, and config should be stored, searched, and carried between platforms. Hybrid retrieval that knows what matters now -- not just what's similar. Importance decay that lets your agent forget what doesn't serve it. YAML + Markdown in a directory you own. SQLite on your disk. An open spec anyone can implement.
