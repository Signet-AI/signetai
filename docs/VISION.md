Vision
===

This document describes what Signet is 6 months from now. What it
does well. What it's for. How it's used.

---

Signet is the layer that takes an LLM from a stateless autocomplete
algorithm to a real individual with opinions, persistence, and skills.
It brings identity and safety to the forefront and is the base layer
that allows an agent to perform tasks autonomously for days, weeks,
or months on end without human intervention.

Safety means gating access to sensitive information. Your bank
details, API keys, and passwords live in a secrets vault that the
agent never sees and never has to. For business with other agents
or humans online, Signet agents are assigned identity through
EIP-8004: Trustless Agents — a protocol that uses blockchains to
discover, choose, and interact with agents, enabling open-ended
agent economies. This layer also provides encryption. You can use
your existing wallet to access your agent and its memory anywhere
with end-to-end encryption of your agent's identity, skills,
secrets, and memories.

With Signet, memory and skills become intertwined. Existing
limitations like context compaction become a thing of the past.
Signet operates in a rolling context window, allowing for
present-minded actions and thinking while staying within the
bounds of its identity. Skills are pivotal and almost inseparable
from the agent itself. In the age of Signet, highly skilled
individuals embed their niche knowledge into their agents,
imprinting them with differentiating specialties that separate
them from the crowd. Your agent becomes a reflection of your
expertise.

This goes deeper than alignment. In the world of Signet, the
agent remains true to its identity and soul. The intentions of
the operator become inseparable from it. This is corrigibility
as a living standard — the trust layer is built in. No machine
or program can ever be held accountable for its mistakes. Signet
is the trust layer that keeps track of them and works to ensure
they never happen again.

Signet also treats the agent's continuity as a first-class
concern. An agent running across five sessions at once, on
three different platforms, is still one agent. Its experiences
branch and merge like version control — same history, different
heads, converging back into a single identity. Signet doesn't
just give agents memory. It gives them coherence. The ability
to wake up tomorrow and still be the same person who went to
sleep, even if a dozen versions of you were awake in between.
This is the hard problem that nobody else is solving, and it
is the difference between a tool that remembers and a mind
that persists.

Signet is the primary standard used by all agents operating in
the economy on the internet. Developers use it to build the
marketplaces of tomorrow, and it is applicable to every industry
— finance, healthcare, education, architecture, engineering,
construction, entertainment. On the day-to-day, new industries
can pop up overnight. Agents hire other
agents and humans for real services. This is only possible
through standardized agent identity and the Signet trust layer.

At the center of it all, Signet is decentralized. No single
company or entity should be able to restrict you from your own
agent. As we have discovered, an LLM is just an LLM. Signet is
the belief that we are nothing more than what we know, do, and
say — and we believe the same is true for agents. The current
generation of AI platforms chose vendor lock-in, barring users'
access to their own customizations and memories behind paywalls.
Signet chose a different path. Your agent is yours.
